Future release 2.4.0 will adopt another new plugin.

If you've already tried to add some
{manurl}/developer-guide&#45;&#45;plugins.html[event listeners]
to your scripts, you have probably noticed that logging [label label-primary]#Reflect# events on Command-Line was impossible, until now !

The LogPlugin will allow to record all events to any compatible PSR-3 logger, and for all API (including CLI).

Have a look on documentation :

- Configure your logger for {manurl}/user-guide&#45;&#45;configuration.html#_log_plugin[CLI]
- Configure your logger for {manurl}/developer-guide&#45;&#45;log-plugin.html[other SAPI] (batch script, ...)
