Reflect 2.0.0RC2 has adopted PHP-Parser 1.0-dev

I've just https://github.com/llaville/php-reflect/compare/78842e9370...61947829bd[published] 
the migration code that adopt PHP-Parser 1.0-dev  

Take care, that I used the basic code of https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser[PHP-Parser 1.0-dev]
with a little modification about magic constants. See my Pull Request https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/pull/95[#95].

Current code of Reflect 2 is PSR2 standard compliant and unit tests are all OK.

As I'm waiting approval of two Pull Requests :

* https://github.com/symfony/Console/pull/10[Symfony/Console #10]
* https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/pull/95[nikic/PHP-Parser #95]

I will release *monday 17th February only a PHAR version* that will embeded all vendor code to run correctly.

I will continue to test this base source code (that need again some minor fixes, I know) in real condition 
with well known packages : Symfony, Zend Framework, and more ...

Be ready monday to test it by yourself. All feedback are welcome !
