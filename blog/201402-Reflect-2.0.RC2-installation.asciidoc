A little explain about Reflect 2.0.0RC2 and PHAR version.

When I've packaged the PHAR version, I've not used any specific stub, but just
the same launcher as git https://github.com/llaville/php-reflect/blob/v2/bin/reflect[source code version]. 

This is major reason you need to have previously installed PHP_Timer and Symfony/Class-Loader 2.4 or better.

I'll fix this issue, to have a really phar version without any dependencies in first Release Candidate.

Be aware, and sorry for disappointment !
