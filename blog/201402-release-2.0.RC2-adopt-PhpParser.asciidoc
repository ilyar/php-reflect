Future release 2.0.0RC2 will adopt PHP-Parser

Two weeks ago, I've detected performance issues with the core of Reflect parser.
I've then begun to rewrite the core of the parser, and now I don't like it.

It's not enough stable, and I don't want to loose my time to test all conditions.

So, that this the reason why I've adopted yesterday a new external parser written in PHP :
https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser[PHP-Parser]. This parser is awesome and fast.
Easy to understand how to implement (uses visitors design and an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree[Abstract Syntax Tree] (AST)).

I've migrated in one day my code to use this new parser, and I've begin this morning to test it in real condition.

I should publish the latest version of my source code tomorrow.

It sound nice to me that *the second release candidate will be available this monday 17th February*.
