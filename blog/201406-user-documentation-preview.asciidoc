With help of Remi Collet (reviewer), thanks to him, we can today propose you the full
documentation of upcoming release 2.1.0, planned for July 4, 2014.

NOTE: If you want to contribute to enhance its contents, don't hesitate and open an
https://github.com/llaville/php-reflect/issues[issue].

This documentation covers [label label-primary]#Reflect# [label label-success]*2.0* and [label label-success]*2.1* 
organized in three guides :

- a {docbaseurl}user-guide.html[user guide] for everyone
- a {docbaseurl}developer-guide.html[developer guide] for those who want to extends phpreflect
- a {docbaseurl}migration-guide.html[migration guide] to easily migrate from version 1.9 to 2.1

To celebrate this milestone, the blog was full rebuilt with the 
[label label-info]#Cerulean# theme (from http://bootswatch.com/[Bootswatch]),
accordingly to the documentation skin.
