[WARNING]
====
The [label label-primary]#Reflect# Command-Line Interface always needs a file in http://json.org/[JSON] format to run.
It should be found either in the current, `$HOME/.config/`, or `/etc` directory.

By setting the `REFLECT` environment variable it is possible to set the filename
of `phpreflect.json` to something else.

E.g:  `REFLECT=my-phpreflect.json`
====

It's very usefull to validate structure of the json configuration file before to run any command
of [label label-primary]#Reflect#

.Just run the command below
====
----
$ phpreflect validate
