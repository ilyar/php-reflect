First Release Candidate of
http://php5.laurent-laville.org/reflect/manual/2.0/en/landing.html[Reflect 2.0]
has just been released.

After several long weeks of development, I'm proud today to propose you,
the next major API of PHP Reflect.

Documentation is not yet complete, and offline versions are not yet available.
Be patient, it should come for the beginning of year 2014.

The final stable version is planned to be released on February 2014.
