News :

* add new `--manifest` option for PHAR distribution to show dependencies bundled
* add new `validate` command to check syntax of your JSON configuration file

Changes :

* `HOME` syntax is compatible both Linux and Windows to look for JSON configuration file, and file cache location (see cache plugin)
* clean-up code (removed unused Use statements)
* Cache plugin may now be used with all API (including CLI)
* Cache in CLI mode provide a new command `cache:clear` to clean selective contents (by data source) of previous cached results
* Cache in CLI mode is verbose when you used the `--profile` option
* remove `require-dev` entries in composer.json

Bugs :

* invalidate a cache entry when source code is modified (Thanks to Remi Collet to notice me issue)
