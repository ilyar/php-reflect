To avoid losing time in the preparation of each release, I've
https://github.com/llaville/php-reflect/commit/07930ed2a302b5746e66da6b8f9ff3dc9eb24ffe[updated]
the old phing script used for [label label-primary]#Reflect# v1.x and PEAR packages.

This phing script is not a standalone solution, because it use a new project I'm still working on
called *bartlett/phing-builder*.

It should be release soon as an open source project. Stay tune !
