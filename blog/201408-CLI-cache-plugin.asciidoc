While release 2.2.0 offered the new cache plugin feature, it was just for other SAPI
than CLI. 

Now it's time to provide cache also for the Command-Line.

A pre-version of manual for version 2.3 is online at url http://php5.laurent-laville.org/reflect/manual/2.3/en/

You'll find cache CLI documentation at page http://php5.laurent-laville.org/reflect/manual/2.3/en/user-guide--configuration.html#_cache_plugin

BTW, there is no more a PDF US, but only a PDF (A4) available.
