New major version and API rewritten specially for PHP 5.3 and greater.

Additions and changes:
- Implement Event Driven Architecture powered by the Symfony EventDispatcher component.
- More data source can be parse. Implement a new source provider powered by the Symfony Finder component. 
- Each element found during parsing can be exploited by an API almost equivalent to PHP5 Reflection.

This first release candidate is published for test purpose only, and should not be used yet in production.
